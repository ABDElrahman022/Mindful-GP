                    <p>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterized by uncontrollable, recurring thoughts (obsessions) and behaviors (compulsions) that individuals feel compelled to repeat.</p>
                    <p>These intrusive thoughts and repetitive actions can significantly interfere with daily life, causing distress and anxiety.</p>
                    <p className='fs-5 mt-5'>Symptoms of OCD</p>
                    <p>Obsessions : Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are intrusive and unwanted. Examples include fear of contamination, doubts about whether doors are locked, or aggressive impulses.</p>
                    <p>Compulsions : Repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed in response to obsessions. Examples include excessive handwashing, checking locks multiple times, or counting silently.</p>
                    <p className='fs-5 mt-5'>Causes of OCD</p>
                    <p>Genetic Factors : A family history of OCD increases the risk.</p>
                    <p>Brain Structure and Function : Differences in brain structure, particularly in areas related to fear and anxiety, may contribute to OCD.</p>
                    <p>Neurotransmitter Imbalances : Abnormalities in serotonin levels have been linked to OCD symptoms.</p>
                    <p>Environmental Factors : Traumatic life events or stressful situations can trigger or worsen OCD symptoms.</p>
                    <p className='fs-5 mt-5'>Treatment Options</p>
                    <p>Therapy :</p>
                    <p>Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) : The gold standard for treating OCD, ERP involves gradually exposing individuals to feared situations while preventing compulsive behaviors.</p>
                    <p>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) : Helps individuals challenge irrational thoughts and develop healthier coping strategies.</p>
                    <p>Medication : Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine, sertraline, and clomipramine are commonly prescribed.</p>
                    <p>Lifestyle Changes : Stress management techniques, such as mindfulness meditation and yoga, can reduce symptoms.</p>
                    <p>Building a strong support system with family and friends is crucial.</p>
