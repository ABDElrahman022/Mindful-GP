                    <p>Schizophrenia is a complex mental health disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. Despite its portrayal in media, schizophrenia is not about having a "split personality" or being violent. Instead, it involves a range of symptoms that disrupt perception, thinking, and emotions.</p>
                    <p className='fs-5 mt-5'>Symptoms of Schizophrenia</p>
                    <p>Positive Symptoms :  Hallucinations (hearing voices or seeing things that aren't there), delusions (false beliefs), and disorganized speech or behavior.</p>
                    <p>Negative Symptoms : Lack of motivation, reduced emotional expression, and difficulty experiencing pleasure.</p>
                    <p>Cognitive Symptoms: Problems with attention, memory, and decision-making.</p>
                    <p className='fs-5 mt-5'>Causes of Schizophrenia</p>
                    <p>Genetic Factors : A family history of schizophrenia increases the risk.</p>
                    <p>Brain Structure and Function : Differences in brain structure and function, particularly in areas involved in processing information.</p>
                    <p>Neurotransmitter Imbalances : Abnormalities in dopamine and glutamate levels may contribute to symptoms.</p>
                    <p>Environmental Factors : Prenatal exposure to infections, malnutrition, or substance abuse can increase the risk.</p>
                    <p className='fs-5 mt-5'>Treatment Options</p>
                    <p>Medication : Antipsychotic medications like risperidone, olanzapine, and clozapine are effective in managing positive symptoms.</p>
                    <p>Psychotherapy : Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and family therapy can help individuals cope with symptoms and improve relationships.</p>
                    <p>Rehabilitation Programs : Vocational training and social skills training can help individuals reintegrate into society.</p>
