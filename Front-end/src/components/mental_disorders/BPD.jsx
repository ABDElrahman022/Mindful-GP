                    <p className='fs-5 mt-5'>Causes of BPD</p>
                    <p>Genetic Factors : A family history of personality disorders increases the risk.</p>
                    <p>Brain Chemistry : Differences in brain structure, particularly in areas regulating emotions, may contribute to symptoms.</p>
                    <p>Environmental Factors : Childhood trauma, neglect, or abuse can play a significant role in the development of BPD.</p>
                    <p className='fs-5 mt-5'>Treatment Options</p>
                    <p>Therapy :</p>
                    <p>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) : Focuses on teaching skills for emotion regulation, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>Schema-Focused Therapy : Helps individuals identify and change deep-seated patterns of thinking and behavior.</p>
                    <p>Medication :</p>
                    <p>While no specific medication treats BPD, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, or antipsychotics may help manage co-occurring symptoms.</p>

                    <p>Building a strong support network of family, friends, and mental health professionals is crucial.</p>
